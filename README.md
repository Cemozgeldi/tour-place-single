# tour-place-single

While doing this project, I used SCSS and React technologies.First of all, I kept my immutable SCSS files in a separate folder.Then I wrote each component's own SCSS files and paired them with each other.I have imported separate components into some of the components.If you want to see the live version of the project, you can click on the link I left below.
